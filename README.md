## Getting Started

Welcome to the microbenchmarking-setup. This is a piece of code to run example benchmarks on complicated JSON parsing e.g., decoding.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `app/src/main/java-org-example-app/MyBenchmark.java`: the entry point folder
- `lib`: the future folder to maintain potential dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Dependency Management

Gradle is used to manage dependencies.
